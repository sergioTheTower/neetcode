Given an array of integers `numbers` that is sorted in **non-decreasing order**.

Return the indices (**1-indexed**) of two numbers, `[index1, index2]`, such that they add up to a given target number `target` and `index1 < index2`. Note that `index1` and `index2` cannot be equal, therefore you may not use the same element twice.

There will always be **exactly one valid solution**.

**Requirement:** Your solution must use **O(1)** additional space.
