## 📝 Problem Description

Given an array of integers `nums`, return the length of the **longest consecutive sequence** of elements that can be formed.

A **consecutive sequence** is a sequence of elements in which each element is exactly `1` greater than the previous element. The elements do **not** have to be consecutive in the original array.

> **Requirement:** You must write an algorithm that runs in **O(n)** time.

## 💡 Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**

```text
nums = [2, 20, 4, 10, 3, 4, 5]
```

**Output:** 4

### Example 2

**Input:**

```text
nums = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 6, 1, 1]
```

**Output:** 7

### Constraints

- 0 <= nums.length <= 1000

- -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9

```

```
